Here is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor** game in python.

## Module 

### Random module
The **random** module is a **built-in** module to generate the pseudo-random variables. It can be used perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, selecting a random elements from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc.

#### Generate Random Floats

The ```random.random()``` method returns a random float number between 0.0 to 1.0. The function doesn't need any arguments. 

#### Generate Random Integers

The ```random.randint()``` method returns a random integer between the specified integers. 

#### Generate Random Numbers within Range

The ```random.randrange()``` method returns a randomly selected element from the range created by the start, stop and step arguments. The value of start is 0 by default. Similarly, the value of step is 1 by default. 

#### Select Random Elements

The ```random.choice()``` method returns a randomly selected element from a non-empty sequence. An empty sequence as argument raises an IndexError. 

#### Shuffle Elements Randomly

The ```random.shuffle()``` method randomly reorders the elements in a list.
